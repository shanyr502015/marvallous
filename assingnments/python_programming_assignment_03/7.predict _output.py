# Dynamic Typing

a = 5
print(type(a)) # <class 'int'>
a = 5.5
print(type(a)) # <class 'float'>
a = "Python"
print(type(a)) # <class 'str'>

# What Python feature does this demonstrate? Dynamic Typing
# In Python, no need to declare variable’s data type.
    # same variable a can hold:
        # integer
        # then float
        # then string
# Python automatically changes type based on value assigned.

# so we can say Python is dynamically typed language, where variable can change its data type during program execution.
