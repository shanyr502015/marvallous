🧠 One-Line Memory Trick
        UT → “Does my code work?”
        Integration → “Do modules talk correctly?”
        SIT → “Does the full system work?”
        UAT → “Does business accept it?”

UT → Code
Integration → Flow/modules
SIT → End-to-End/system
UAT → Business

🔹 Unit Testing (UT)
        Tests smallest part of code (function / module).
        Done by developers.
        Checks logic correctness of individual components.
        Example: Testing a Python function that calculates tax.

🔹 Integration Testing
        Tests interaction between modules/components.
        Done after unit testing.
        Ensures data flows correctly between systems.
        Example: IDL → Curated → BSIG data flow working properly.

🔹 System Integration Testing (SIT)
        Tests complete system end-to-end in test environment.
        Done by QA team.
        Validates business + technical flows together.
        Example: Source → IDL → Curated → Reports end-to-end validation.

🔹 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
        Tests system from business/user perspective.
        Done by business users / clients.
        Confirms system meets business requirements.
        Example: Finance team validates GL balances and reports.



🔷 Real Project Example (Finance Data Warehouse)

🔹 Unit Testing (UT): Test Spark SQL / Python logic individually
        Example: Validate batch_id generation logic, Check GL amount calculation function
        👉 Question answered: “Is my code correct?”

🔹 Integration Testing: Test interaction between systems
        Example:IDL output correctly consumed by Curated, Curated tables readable by BSIG
        👉 Question answered: “Are systems talking properly?”

🔹 System Integration Testing (SIT): Test end-to-end flow
        Example:Source → IDL → Curated → Reporting, Batch control, counts, sums, error handling
        👉 Question answered: “Does full pipeline work?”

🔹 User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Business validates results
        Example: Finance team checks GL balances, Reports match legacy system
        👉 Question answered: “Can business sign off?”

🔷 Interview-Ready 2-Line Answer
    Unit testing validates individual code logic,
    Integration testing ensures modules interact correctly,
    SIT validates full end-to-end system behavior, and
    UAT confirms the solution meets business expectations.
