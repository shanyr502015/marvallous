# while loops for digit manipulation
# Integer division (//) and modulo (%) operators
# Boolean flags (is_prime)
# break statement to exit loops early
# Reversing numbers using mathematical operations
# Comparing original and reversed numbers for palindrome check

# How the digit extraction works:
    # temp % 10 gets the last digit
    # temp // 10 removes the last digit
    # Repeat until temp becomes 0
