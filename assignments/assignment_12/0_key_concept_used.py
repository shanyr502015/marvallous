# in operator to check membership in a string
# range() function with different parameters:
    # range(1, num + 1) - starts from 1 to num
    # range(num, 0, -1) - starts from num down to 1 (reverse)
# Modulo operator (%) to find factors
# Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
# end=" " to print on the same line with space separation

# Notes:
    # For problem 3, if you want integer division, use // instead of /
    # For problem 1, the solution checks both lowercase and uppercase vowels
    # The range(start, stop, step) function is very useful for controlling loop iteration
