# float() for decimal input (length, width, radius, marks)
# Mathematical formulas:
#     Rectangle area = length × width
#     Circle area = π × radius²

# Perfect number: A number equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself)
#     Example: 6 = 1 + 2 + 3

# Binary conversion: Repeatedly divide by 2 and collect remainders
# Conditional statements with elif for grade classification

# Notes:
# For problem 3, proper divisors are all divisors except the number itself
# For problem 4, the manual method builds the binary string in reverse order
# For problem 5, the conditions are checked in order from highest to lowest
