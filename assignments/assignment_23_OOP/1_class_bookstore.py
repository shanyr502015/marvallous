""" Write a Python program to implement a class named BookStore with the following specifications:
• The class should contain two instance variables:
        o Name (Book Name)
        o Author (Book Author)
• The class should contain one class variable:
        o NoOfBooks (initialize it to 0)
• Define a constructor (__init__) that accepts Name and Author and initializes instance variables.
• Inside the constructor, increment the class variable NoOfBooks by 1 whenever a new object is created.
• Implement an instance method:
        o Display() : should display book details in the format: <BookName> by <Author>. No of books: <NoOfBooks>
Example usage:
Obj1 = BookStore("Linux System Programming", "Robert Love")
Obj1.Display()   # Linux System Programming by Robert Love. No of books: 1
Obj2 = BookStore("C Programming", "Dennis Ritchie")
Obj2.Display()   # C Programming by Dennis Ritchie. No of books: 2 """

class BookStore:

    def __init__(self, Name, Author):
        self.Name = Name
        self.Author = Author
        # Increment class variable by 1 whenever a new object is created
        BookStore.NoOfBooks += 1
