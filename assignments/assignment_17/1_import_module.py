# Create on module named as Arithmetic which contains 4 functions as Add() for addition, Sub() for subtraction, Mult() for multiplication and Div() for division. 
# All functions accepts two parameters as number and perform the operation. 
# Write on python program which call all the functions from Arithmetic module by accepting the parameters from user.
